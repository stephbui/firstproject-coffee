      L'Amour du caf√©
    </h3>
    <p class=amourducaf√©>
      Have you ever heard of speciality coffee? Also called the third wave? <br>
      <br>
      Like wine, coffee is a product of the terroir. It means that coffee from Colombia doesn't gonna taste the same
      then coffee from Etiopia.
      Each terroir gonna give the coffee beans it's compelex aroma. So you could be able to savoured some hints of nuts,
      caramel or even chocolate in your cup of coffee!
      The way we process, roast and brew coffee also influence how the aroma is extracted. Speciality coffee pays
      attention to those details,
      and remind us the complexicity of this fruit! Because yes coffee is a fruit! Ok... enought nerding about
      coffee!<br>
      <br>
      Montreal has a growing community of coffee'shops that serve speciality coffee. Here is a sneak peek of my
      favourite caf√©s in Montreal! Cheers!!!!

      Have you ever dream of drinking your cup of coffee in an old bank? Crew Collective & Caf√© is one of the most
      beautiful caf√©s in Montreal!
      The caf√© was built on the main floor of the former Royal Bank of Canada.
      Here you would enjoy and benefit from a space with beautiful architecture and history, while drinking good coffee
      and enjoying good food!
      An inspiring place conducive to productivity and creativity!

      Bless with four locations in Montreal, my favourite Caf√© Pista is situated in Quartier des Spectables!
      If you never had the chance to visit Montreal yet, Quartier des Spectacles is in the heart of the city and where a
      lot of festivities are happening!
      There coffe is ethically selected and sustainable, roasted to perfection for the pleasure of your palate!
